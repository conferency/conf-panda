                    <h4>Provide, improve and develop Services.</h4>

We also use information we have to provide shortcuts and suggestions to you. </p>

                    <p>When we have location information, we use it to tailor our Services for you and others, like helping you to check-in and find local events or offers in your area or tell your friends that you are nearby. </p>

                    <p>We conduct surveys and research, test features in development, and analyze the information we have to evaluate and improve products and services, develop new products or features, and conduct audits and troubleshooting activities.</p>

                    <h4>Communicate with you.</h4>

                    <p>We use your information to send you marketing communications, communicate with you about our Services and let you know about our policies and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.</p>

                    <h4>Promote safety and security.</h4>

                    <p>We use the information we have to help verify accounts and activity, and to promote safety and security on and off of our Services, such as by investigating suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies. We work hard to protect your account using teams of engineers, automated systems, and advanced technology such as encryption and machine learning. </p>

                    <p>We use cookies and similar technologies to provide and support our Services and each of the uses outlined and described in this section of our policy. Read our <a href="{{ url_for('main.policies', policy_name='cookies') }}">Cookie Policy</a> to learn more.</p>

                    <h2 class="article-section">How is this information shared?</h2>

                    <p>Sharing On Our Services. People use our Services to connect and share with others. We make this possible by sharing your information in the following ways:</p>

                    <h4>People you share and communicate with.</h4>

                    <p>When you share and communicate using our Services, you choose the audience who can see what you share.

                    <h4>People that see content others share about you.</h4>

                    <p>Other people may use our Services to share content about you with the audience they choose. If you have concerns with someone’s post, social reporting is a way for people to quickly and easily ask for help from someone they trust.</p>

                    <p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Services or their assets changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner. </p>

                    <p>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, we may provide information to third-party partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud and abuse on and off of our Services. Information we receive about you, including financial transaction data related to purchases made with Conferency, may be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also may retain information from accounts disabled for violations of our terms for at least a year to prevent repeat abuse or other violations of our terms.</p>
