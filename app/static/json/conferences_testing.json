    "Summary": "Our world is increasingly struggling with a number of serious\u2014and often interrelated\u2014problems. The climate is changing, leading to rising sea levels, enduring droughts, expansion of deserts and extreme weather. Population is predicted to grow from seven billion in 2010 to eleven billion in 2100, implying a huge and ever-rising demand for energy, water supply, and many kinds of other resources. A growing percentage of the population will live in cities, urging planners to develop new concepts for mobility, logistics, housing and other services. Inequalities in terms of demographics, income levels, education, and quality of life challenge our sense of distribution justice and raise the risk of wars, terrorism, and revolutionary movements. How can our strategic management discipline contribute to addressing these real-world challenges? How can we, as strategy scholars, ensure that our research is practically relevant, and that we support firms and institutional actors in (re-)defining their roles within society?",
